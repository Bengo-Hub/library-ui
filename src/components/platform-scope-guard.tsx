/**
 * PlatformScopeGuard — confines any cross-tenant "platform drill-in" to the
 * `/platform` section, so every normal business page is always scoped to the
 * platform owner's OWN tenant (codevertex).
 *
 * Model "Dedicated Platform section" (see
 * .claude/plans/platform-owner-self-tenant-separation.md): the main app
 * `/{orgSlug}/*` = the owner's own business by default; cross-tenant
 * administration is confined to `/{orgSlug}/platform/*`. Leaving `/platform`
 * must clear the drill-in.
 *
 * library-ui has no `?tenantId=` cross-tenant selector today — own-tenant
 * scoping is driven entirely by the JWT's own tenant claim via
 * `apiClient.setTenantInfo(...)` (always the owner's own tenant), and the
 * BranchFilter is a within-tenant branch switcher (X-Outlet-ID), not a
 * cross-tenant drill-in. The only platform-scoped lever on the API client is
 * `setPlatformOwner()`, which (when true) suppresses the `X-Tenant-*` headers so
 * the backend falls back to the caller's own tenant claim. This guard keeps that
 * lever pinned OFF on every non-platform route, so business pages can never
 * accidentally drop their own-tenant headers, and provides the canonical home
 * for clearing a future cross-tenant drill-in when one is added.
